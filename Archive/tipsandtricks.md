There are a few extras throughout this lab that are designed to make your lab experience a smooth and simple process.  Below are some icons you should watch out for that will save you time during each task.

## Interactive Elements

- Each task contains a series of steps required for successful completion of the lab.  To track your progress throughout the lab, check the box to the left of the numbered series.

- Throughout the lab, you will see text with a letter **T** in a square to the left.  This indicates that you can **click on the text** and it will **type it for you** in the VM.  **This will save you lots of time**.

- Additionally you will a @lab.CtrlAltDelete button that will press **Ctrl-Alt-Delete** in the active VM.

- The last interactive element you will see throughout the lab is the **Open Screenshot** text below many steps.  To reduce clutter, most screenshots have been configured to launch in a popup window.  The only ones left visible are ones that could cause issues if they are missed or if there are multiple elements that are easier to understand with visual representation.

## Additional Information

There are also Knowledge Items, Notes, and Hints throughout the lab.

- Knowledge Items are used to provide additional information about a topic related to the task or step.  These are often collapsed to reduce the amount of space they use, but it is recommended that you review these items if you want more information on the subject.

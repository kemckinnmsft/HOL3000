# Exercise 3: Client Configuration
[ðŸ”™](#azure-information-protection)

Now that we have defined some basic AIP Policies, we need to configure some clients to demonstrate the Discovery, Classification, and Protection capabilities of Azure Information Protection.  In this exercise, we will configure Office 365 Applications for 3 test users to demonstrate these policy actions.  

Office 365 and the latest GA AIP Client (1.37.19.0) have already been installed on these systems to save time in this lab.  In your production environment, you will need to install the AIP Client manually for testing or using an Enterprise Deployment Tool like System Center Configuration Manager for widespread deployment.

We will also be disabling a mail flow rule in the Exchange Admin Center to allow mail to be sent outside the tenant.  This will allow us to test Do Not Forward and Office 365 Message Encryption scenarios.

# Configuring Applications
[ðŸ”™](#azure-information-protection)
 
In this task, we will configure Word and Outlook for 3 test users.  These users are Alan Steiner (AlanS) and Amy Alberts (AmyA) who we have defined as members of the Legal group, and Eric Gruber (EricG).  

This will allow us to demonstrate the differences between the global and scoped policy and demonstrate some of the protection features of Azure Information Protection in the next exercise.

# Testing AIP Policies
[:arrow_left: Home](#azure-information-protection)

Now that you have 3 test systems with users being affected by different policies configured, we can start testing these policies.  This exercise will run through various scenarios to demonstrate the use of AIP global and scoped policies and show the functionality of recommended and automatic labeling. This Exercise will walk you through the items below.

- [Testing User Defined Permissions](#testing-user-defined-permissions)
- [Testing Global Policy](#testing-global-policy)
- [Testing Scoped Policy](#testing-scoped-policy)
- [Testing Recommended and Automatic Classification](#testing-recommended-and-automatic-classification)

> [!ALERT] If you see a warning about a metered connection in Office, click **Connect anyway** to allow Office to connect.  If you do not do this you will get errors when connecting to the AIP service. The VMs are set to metered to increase network speed.

## Testing User Defined Permissions

One of the most common use cases for AIP is the ability to send emails using User Defined Permissions (Do Not Forward). In this task, we will send an email using the Do Not Forward label to test that functionality.


1. [] On @lab.VirtualMachine(Client03).SelectLink, log in using the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.
2. [] Launch Microsoft Outlook, and click **Accept and start Outlook**.
3. [] In the username box, type ```EvanG@@lab.cloudcredential(82).TenantName``` and click **Connect**.
4. [] When prompted, type ```pass@word1``` and Sign in.
5. [] On the Use this account everywhere page, click **Yes** then click **Done**.
6. [] Once configuration completes, **uncheck the box** to **Set up Outlook Mobile** and click **OK**.
7. [] **Close Outlook** and **reopen** to complete activation.
8. [] Once Outlook opens, if you receive a metered connection warning, click **Connect anyway**.
9. [] Click on the **New email** button.

8. [] Send an email to **Adam Smith** and **Alice Anderson** (```Adam Smith;Alice Anderson```). You may **optionally add an external email address** (preferably from a major social provider like gmail, yahoo, or outlook.com) to test the external recipient experience. For the **Subject** and **Body** type ```Test Do Not Forward Email```.

10. [] Switch over to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).SelectLink, log in using the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++ and open Outlook. 
11. [] Run through setup, this time using the credentials ```AdamS@@lab.CloudCredential(82).TenantName``` and ```pass@word1```. 
12. [] Review the email in Adam Smith’s Outlook.  You will notice that the email is automatically shown in Outlook natively.

	> [!Hint] The **Do Not Forward** protection template will normally prevent the sharing of the screen and taking screenshots when protected documents or emails are loaded.  However, since this screenshot was taken within a VM, the operating system was unaware of the protected content and could not prevent the capture.  
	>
	>It is important to understand that although we put controls in place to reduce risk, if a user has view access to a document or email they can take a picture with their smartphone or even retype the message. That said, if the user is not authorized to read the message then it will not even render and we will demonstrate that next.

	> [!KNOWLEDGE] If you elected to send a Do Not Forward message to an external email, you will have an experience similar to the images below.  These captures are included to demonstrate the functionality for those that chose not to send an external message.
	>
	> !IMAGE[tzj04wi9.jpg](\Media\tzj04wi9.jpg)
	> 
	> Here the user has received an email from Evan Green and they can click on the **Read the message** button.
	>
	>!IMAGE[wiefwcho.jpg](\Media\wiefwcho.jpg)
	>
	>Next, the user is given the option to either log in using the social identity provider (**Sign in with Google**, Yahoo, Microsoft Account), or to **sign in with a one-time passcode**.
	>
	>If they choose the social identity provider login, it should use the token previously cached by their browser and display the message directly.
	>
	>If they choose one-time passcode, they will receive an email like the one below with the one-time passcode.
	>
	>!IMAGE[m6voa9xi.jpg](\Media\m6voa9xi.jpg)
	>
	>They can then use this code to authenticate to the Office 365 Message Encryption portal.
	>
	>!IMAGE[8pllxint.jpg](\Media\8pllxint.jpg)
	>
	>After using either of these authentication methods, the user will see a portal experience like the one shown below.

## Testing Global Policy
[:arrow_up: Top](#exercise-4-testing-aip-policies)

In this task, we will create a document and send an email to demonstrate the functionality defined in the Global Policy.

1. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client03).SelectLink and log in with the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.
1. [] In Microsoft Outlook, click on the **New email** button.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\6wan9me1.jpg)

1. [] Send an email to Adam Smith, Alice Anderson, and yourself (```Adam Smith;Alice Anderson;@lab.User.Email```).  For the **Subject** and **Body** type ```Test Contoso Internal Email```.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\9gkqc9uy.jpg)

1. [] In the Sensitivity Toolbar, click on **Confidential** and then **Contoso Internal** and click **Send**.

  ^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\yhokhtkv.jpg)

1. [] On @lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).SelectLink, log in using the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++ and observe that you are able to open the email natively in the Outlook client. Also observe the **header text** that was defined in the label settings.

	!IMAGE[bxz190x2.jpg](\Media\bxz190x2.jpg)
	
1. [] In your email, note that you will be unable to open this message.  This experience will vary depending on the client you use (the image below is from Outlook 2016 for Mac) but they should have similar messages after presenting credentials. Since this is not the best experience for the recipient, later in the lab we will configure Exchange Online Mail Flow Rules to prevent content classified with internal only labels from being sent to external users.

## Testing Scoped Policy
[:arrow_up: Top](#exercise-4-testing-aip-policies)

In this task, we will create a document and send an email from one of the users in the Legal group to demonstrate the functionality defined in the first exercise. We will also show the behavior of the No Default Label policy on documents.

1. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).SelectLink and log in with the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.
1. [] In Microsoft Outlook, click on the **New email** button.
	
	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\ldjugk24.jpg)
	
1. [] Send an email to Alice Anderson and Evan Green (```Alice Anderson;Evan Green```).  For the **Subject** and **Body** type ```Test Highly Confidential Legal Email```.
1. [] In the Sensitivity Toolbar, click on **Highly Confidential** and the **Legal Only** sub-label, then click **Send**.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\ny1lwv0h.jpg)
1. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client02).SelectLink and log in with the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.
11. [] Run through setup, this time using the credentials ```AliceA@@lab.CloudCredential(82).TenantName``` and ```pass@word1```. 
12. [] Review the email in Alice Anderson’s Outlook. You should be able to open the message natively in the client as Alice.

	!IMAGE[qeqtd2yr.jpg](\Media\qeqtd2yr.jpg)
1. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client03).SelectLink and log in with the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.
2. [] Click on the email. You should be unable to open the message as Evan.

	!IMAGE[6y99u8cl.jpg](\Media\6y99u8cl.jpg)

	> [!Knowledge] You may notice that the Office 365 Message Encryption wrapper message is displayed in the preview pane.  It is important to note that the content of the email is not displayed here.  The content of the message is contained within the encrypted message.rpmsg attachment and only authorized users will be able to decrypt this attachment.
	>
	>!IMAGE[w4npbt49.jpg](\Media\w4npbt49.jpg)
	>
	>If an unauthorized recipient clicks on **Read the message** to go to the OME portal, they will be presented with the same wrapper message.  Like the external recipient from the previous task, this is not an ideal experience. So, you may want to use a mail flow rule to manage scoped labels as well.
	>
	>!IMAGE[htjesqwe.jpg](\Media\htjesqwe.jpg)

1. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).SelectLink and log in with the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.
1. [] Open **Microsoft Word**.
1. [] Create a new **Blank document** and type ```This is a test document``` and **save the document**.

	> [!ALERT] When you click **Save**, you will be prompted to choose a classification.  This is a result of having **None** set as the default label in the scoped policy while requiring all documents to be labeled.  This is a useful for driving **active classification decisions** by specific groups within your organization.  Notice that Outlook still has a default of **General** because of the Advanced setting we added to the scoped policy.  **This is recommended** because user send many more emails each day than they create documents. Actively forcing users to classify each email would be an unpleasant user experience whereas they are typically more understanding of having to classify each document if they are in a sensitive department or role.

1. [] Choose a classification to save the document.

## Testing Recommended and Automatic Classification
[:arrow_up: Top](#exercise-4-testing-aip-policies)

In this task, we will test the configured recommended and automatic conditions we defined in Exercise 1.  Recommended conditions can be used to help organically train your users to classify sensitive data appropriately and provides a method for testing the accuracy of your dectections prior to switching to automatic classification.  Automatic conditions should be used after thorough testing or with items you are certain need to be protected. Although the examples used here are fairly simple, in production these could be based on complex regex statements or only trigger when a specific quantity of sensitive data is present.

1. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client03).SelectLink and log in with the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.
1. [] Launch **Microsoft Word**.
1. [] In Microsoft Word, create a new **Blank document** and type ```My AMEX card number is 344047014854133. The expiration date is 09/28, and the CVV is 4368``` and **save** the document.

	> [!NOTE] This card number is a fake number that was generated using the Credit Card Generator for Testing at [https://developer.paypal.com/developer/creditCardGenerator/](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/creditCardGenerator/).  The Microsoft Classification Engine uses the Luhn Algorithm to prevent false positives so when testing, please make sure to use valid numbers.

1. [] Notice that you are prompted with a recommendation to change the classification to Confidential \ Contoso Internal. Click on **Change now** to set the classification and protect the document.

	!IMAGE[url9875r.jpg](\Media\url9875r.jpg)
	> [!Knowledge] Notice that, like the email in Task 2 of this exercise, the header value configured in the label is added to the document.
	>
	>!IMAGE[dcq31lz1.jpg](\Media\dcq31lz1.jpg)
1. [] In Microsoft Word, create a new **Blank document** and type ```my password is pass@word1``` and **save** the document.

	>[!HINT] Notice that the document is automatically classified and protected wioth the Highly Confidential \ All Employees label.
	>
	>!IMAGE[6vezzlnj.jpg](\Media\6vezzlnj.jpg)
1. [] Next, in Microsoft Outlook, click on the **New email** button.
	
	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\ldjugk24.jpg)
	
1. [] Draft an email to Alice Anderson and Adam Smith (```Alice Anderson;Adam Smith```).  For the **Subject** and **Body** type ```Test Highly Confidential All Employees Automation```.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\4v3wrrop.jpg)
1. [] Attach the **second document you created** to the email.

	!IMAGE[823tzyfd.jpg](\Media\823tzyfd.jpg)

	> [!HINT] Notice that the email was automatically classified as Highly Confidential \ All Employees.  This functionality is highly recommended because matching the email classification to attachments provides a much more cohesive user experience and helps to prevent inadvertent information disclosure in the body of sensitive emails.
	>
	>!IMAGE[yv0afeow.jpg](\Media\yv0afeow.jpg)

1. [] In the email, click **Send**.

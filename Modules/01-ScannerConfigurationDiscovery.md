## Configuring Repositories 
[:arrow_up: Top](#configuring-aip-scanner-for-discovery)

In this task, we will configure repositories to be scanned by the AIP scanner.  As previously mentioned, these can be any type of CIFS file shares including NAS devices sharing over the CIFS protocol.  Additionally, On premises SharePoint 2010, 2013, and 2016 document libraries and lists (attachements) can be scanned.  You can even scan entire SharePoint sites by providing the root URL of the site.  There are several optional 

> [!NOTE] SharePoint 2010 is only supported for customers who have extended support for that version of SharePoint.

The next task is to configure repositories to scan.  These can be on-premises SharePoint 2010, 2013, or 2016 document libraries and any accessible CIFS based share.

1. [] In the Administrative PowerShell window on Scanner01, run the commands below

    ```
    Add-AIPScannerRepository -Path http://Scanner01/documents -SetDefaultLabel Off
	```
	```
	Add-AIPScannerRepository -Path \\Scanner01\documents -SetDefaultLabel Off
    ```
	>[!Knowledge] Notice that we added the **-SetDefaultLabel Off** switch to each of these repositories.  This is necessary because our Global policy has a Default label of **General**.  If we did not add this switch, any file that did not match a condition would be labeled as General when we do the enforced scan.

1. [] To verify the repositories configured, run the command below.
	
    ```
    Get-AIPScannerRepository
    ```

## Running Sensitive Data Discovery 
[:arrow_up: Top](#configuring-aip-scanner-for-discovery)

1. [] Run the commands below to run a discovery cycle.

    ```
	Set-AIPScannerConfiguration -DiscoverInformationTypes All -Enforce Off
	```
	```
	Start-AIPScan
    ```

	> [!Knowledge] Note that we used the DiscoverInformationTypes -All switch before starting the scan.  This causes the scanner to use any custom conditions that you have specified for labels in the Azure Information Protection policy, and the list of information types that are available to specify for labels in the Azure Information Protection policy.  Although the scanner will discover documents to classify, it will not do so because the default configuration for the scanner is Discover only mode.
	
1. [] Right-click on the **Windows** button in the lower left-hand corner and click on **Event Viewer**.

1. [] Expand **Application and Services Logs** and click on **Azure Information Protection**.

	>[!NOTE] You will see an event like the one below when the scanner completes the cycle. If you see a .NET exception, press OK. This is due to SharePoint startup in the VM environment.

1. [] Next, switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).SelectLink and log in using the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.
1. [] Open a **File Explorer** window, and browse to ```\\Scanner01.contoso.azure\c$\users\aipscanner\AppData\Local\Microsoft\MSIP\Scanner\Reports```. Use the credentials below to authenticate:

	```Contoso\LabUser```
	
	```Pa$$w0rd```

1. [] Review the summary txt and detailed csv files available there.  

	>[!Hint] Since there are no Automatic conditions configured yet, the scanner found no matches for the files scanned despite most of them containing sensitive data.

	>The details contained in the DetailedReport.csv can be used to identify the types of sensitive data you need to create AIP rules for in the Azure Portal.

	>[!NOTE] We will revisit this information later in the lab to review discovered data and create Sensitive Data Type to Classification mappings.

	>[!ALERT] If you see any failures, it is likely due to SharePoint startup in the VM environment.  If you rerun Start-AIPScan on Scanner01 all files will successfully scan.  This should not happen in a production environment.

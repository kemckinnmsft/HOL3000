# Exchange Online IRM Capabilities
[:arrow_left: Home](#azure-information-protection)

Exchange Online can work in conjunction with Azure Information Protection to provide advanced capabilities for protecting sensitive data being sent over email.  You can also manage the flow of classified content to ensure that it is not sent to unintended recipients. This Exercise will walk you through the items below.

## Configuring Exchange Online Mail Flow Rules

In this task, we will configure a mail flow rule to detect sensitive information traversing the network in the clear and encrypt it using the Encrypt Only RMS Template.  We will also create a mail flow rule to prevent messages classified as Confidential \ Contoso Internal from being sent to external recipients.

1. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).SelectLink and open an **Admin PowerShell Prompt**.

2. [] Type the commands below to connect to an Exchange Online PowerShell session.  Use the credentials provided when prompted.

	```
	$UserCredential = Get-Credential
	```

	```@lab.CloudCredential(82).Username```

	```@lab.CloudCredential(82).Password```

	```
	$Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $UserCredential -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection
	Import-PSSession $Session
	```

	> [!ALERT] If you did not run through the **Base Configuration** track, run the commands below to remove any rules preventing external collaboration.
	>
	> Get the active Mail Flow Rules by typing the command below:
	>
	> ```
	> Get-TransportRule
	> ```
	>
	> If a rule exists named something similar to **"Delete if sent outside the organization"**, run the code below to remove this rule.
	>
	> ```
	> Remove-TransportRule *Delete*
	> ```

1. [] Create a new Exchange Online Mail Flow Rule using the code below:

	```
	New-TransportRule -Name "Encrypt external mails with sensitive content" -SentToScope NotInOrganization -ApplyRightsProtectionTemplate "Encrypt" -MessageContainsDataClassifications @(@{Name="ABA Routing Number"; minCount="1"},@{Name="Credit Card Number"; minCount="1"},@{Name="Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Number"; minCount="1"},@{Name="International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10-CM)"; minCount="1"},@{Name="International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM)"; minCount="1"},@{Name="U.S. / U.K. Passport Number"; minCount="1"},@{Name="U.S. Bank Account Number"; minCount="1"},@{Name="U.S. Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)"; minCount="1"},@{Name="U.S. Social Security Number (SSN)"; minCount="1"})
	```

	>[!KNOWLEDGE] This mail flow rule can be used to encrypt sensitive data leaving via email.  This can be customized to add additional sensitive data types. A breakdown of the command is listed below.
	>
	>New-TransportRule 
	>
	>-Name "Encrypt external mails with sensitive content" 
	>
	>-SentToScope NotInOrganization 
	>
	>-ApplyRightsProtectionTemplate "Encrypt" 
	>
	>-MessageContainsDataClassifications @(@{Name="ABA Routing Number"; minCount="1"},@{Name="Credit Card Number"; minCount="1"},@{Name="Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Number"; minCount="1"},@{Name="International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10-CM)"; minCount="1"},@{Name="International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM)"; minCount="1"},@{Name="U.S. / U.K. Passport Number"; minCount="1"},@{Name="U.S. Bank Account Number"; minCount="1"},@{Name="U.S. Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)"; minCount="1"},@{Name="U.S. Social Security Number (SSN)"; minCount="1"})
	
	> [!HINT] Next, we need to capture the **Label ID** for the **Confidential \ All Employees** label. 

1. [] Switch to the Azure Portal and under **Classifications** click on Labels, then expand **Confidential** and click on **All Employees**.

	!IMAGE[w2w5c7xc.jpg](\Media\w2w5c7xc.jpg)

	> [!HINT] If you closed the azure portal, open an Edge InPrivate window and navigate to ```https://portal.azure.com```.

1. [] In the Label: All Employees blade, scroll down to the Label ID and **copy** the value.

	!IMAGE[lypurcn5.jpg](\Media\lypurcn5.jpg)

	> [!ALERT] Make sure that there are no spaces before or after the Label ID as this will cause the mail flow rule to be ineffective.

1. [] Next, return to the PowerShell window and type +++$labelid = "+++ then paste the **LabelID** for the **All Employees** label, type +++"+++, and press **Enter**.
1. [] Now, create another Exchange Online Mail Flow Rule using the code below:

	```
	$labeltext = "MSIP_Label_"+$labelid+"_enabled=true"
	New-TransportRule -name "Block Confidential Contoso All Employees" -SentToScope notinorganization -HeaderContainsMessageHeader  "msip_labels" -HeaderContainsWord $labeltext -RejectMessageReasonText “Contoso internal messages cannot be sent to external recipients.”
	```

	>[!KNOWLEDGE] This mail flow rule can be used to prevent internal only communications from being sent to an external audience.
	>
	>New-TransportRule 
	>
	>-name "Block Confidential Contoso All Employees" 
	>
	>-SentToScope notinorganization 
	>
	>-HeaderContainsMessageHeader "msip_labels" 
	>
	>-HeaderContainsWord $labeltext 
	>
	>-RejectMessageReasonText “Contoso internal messages cannot be sent to external recipients.”

	>[!NOTE] In a production environment, customers would want to create a rule like this for each of their labels that they did not want going externally.

## Demonstrating Exchange Online Mail Flow Rules
[:arrow_up: Top](#exercise-6-exchange-online-irm-capabilities)

In this task, we will send emails to demonstrate the results of the Exchange Online mail flow rules we configured in the previous task.  This will demonstrate some ways to protect your sensitive data and ensure a positive user experience with the product.

1. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client03).SelectLink and log in with the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.

2. [] Open an InPrivate browsing session and browse to ```https://outlook.office365.com/owa/```.

1. [] Log in using the credentials below.

	> ```EvanG@@lab.CloudCredential(82).TenantName```
	>
	> ```pass@word1```

3. [] Send an email to Adam Smith, Alice Anderson, and yourself (```Adam Smith;Alice Anderson;@lab.User.Email```).  For the **Subject**, type ```Test Credit Card Email``` and for the **Body**, type ```My AMEX card number is 344047014854133. The expiration date is 09/28, and the CVV is 4368```, then click **Send**.

4. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).SelectLink and log in with the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.
5. [] Review the received email.

  !IMAGE[pidqfaa1.jpg](\Media\pidqfaa1.jpg)

	> [!Knowledge] Note that there is no encryption applied to the message.  That is because we set up the rule to only apply to external recipients.  If you were to leave that condition out of the mail flow rule, internal recipients would also receive an encrypted copy of the message.  The image below shows the encrypted message that was received externally.
	>
	>!IMAGE[c5foyeji.jpg](\Media\c5foyeji.jpg)
	>
	>Below is another view of the same message received in Outlook Mobile on an iOS device.
	>
	>!IMAGE[599ljwfy.jpg](\Media\599ljwfy.jpg)

6. [] Next, in Microsoft Outlook, click on the **New email** button.

  ^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\6wan9me1.jpg)
. [] Send an email to Evan Green, Alice Anderson, and yourself (```Evan Green;Alice Anderson;@lab.User.Email```).  For the **Subject** and **Body** type ```Another Test Contoso Internal Email```.

  ^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\d476fmpg.jpg)

8. [] In the Sensitivity Toolbar, click on **Confidential** and then **All Employees** and click **Send**.

  ^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\yhokhtkv.jpg)

9. [] In about a minute, you should receive an **Undeliverable** message from Exchange with the users that the message did not reach and the message you defined in the previous task.

  !IMAGE[kgjvy7ul.jpg](\Media\kgjvy7ul.jpg)

	> [!NOTE] This rule may take a few minutes to take effect, so if you do not get the undeliverable message, try again in a few minutes.

	> [!HINT] There are many other use cases for Exchange Online mail flow rules but this should give you a quick view into what is possible and how easy it is to improve the security of your sensitive data through the use of Exchange Online mail flow rules and Azure Information Protection.

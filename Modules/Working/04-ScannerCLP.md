# AIP Scanner Classification, Labeling, and Protection
[:arrow_left: Home](#azure-information-protection)

The Azure Information Protection scanner allows you to  classify and protect sensitive information stored in on-premises CIFS file shares and SharePoint sites.  

In this exercise, you will change the condition we created previously from a recommended to an automatic classification rule.  After that, we will run the AIP Scanner in enforce mode to classify and protect the identified sensitive data. This Exercise will walk you through the items below.

	- [Defining Automatic Conditions](#defining-automatic-conditions)
	- [Enforcing Configured Rules](#enforcing-configured-rules)

## Defining Automatic Conditions
[:arrow_up: Top](#aip-scanner-classification-labeling-and-protection)

One of the most powerful features of Azure Information Protection is the ability to guide your users in making sound decisions around safeguarding sensitive data.  This can be achieved in many ways through user education or reactive events such as blocking emails containing sensitive data. 

However, helping your users to properly classify and protect sensitive data at the time of creation is a more organic user experience that will achieve better results long term.  In this task, we will define some basic recommended and automatic conditions that will trigger based on certain types of sensitive data.

1. [] On @lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).SelectLink, log in with the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.
2. [] Open the browser window with the Azure Portal (AIP Blade).
3. [] Under **Dashboards** on the left, click on **Data discovery (Preview)** to view the results of the discovery scan we performed previously.

	> [!KNOWLEDGE] Notice that there are no labeled or protected files shown at this time.  This uses the AIP P1 discovery functionality available with the AIP Scanner. Only the predefined Office 365 Sensitive Information Types are available with AIP P1 as Custom Sensitive Information Types require automatic conditions to be defined, which is an AIP P2 feature.

	> [!NOTE] Now that we know the sensitive information types that are most common in this environment, we can use that information to create **Recommended** conditions that will help guide user behavior when they encounter this type of data.

	> [!ALERT] If no data is shown, it may still be processing. Continue with the lab and come back to see the results later.

1. [] Under **Classifications** on the left, click **Labels** then expand **Confidential**, and click on **All Employees**.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\jyw5vrit.jpg)
1. [] In the Label: All Employees blade, scroll down to the **Configure conditions for automatically applying this label** section, and click on **+ Add a new condition**.

	!IMAGE[cws1ptfd.jpg](\Media\cws1ptfd.jpg)
1. [] In the Condition blade, in the **Select information types** search box, type ```EU``` and check the boxes next to the **items shown below**.

	!IMAGE[xaj5hupc.jpg](\Media\xaj5hupc.jpg)

1. [] Click **Save** in the Condition blade and **OK** to the Save settings prompt.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\41o5ql2y.jpg)
1. [] In the Labels: All Employees blade, in the **Configure conditions for automatically applying this label** section, click **Automatic**.

1. [] Click **Save** in the Label: All Employees blade and **OK** to the Save settings prompt.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\rimezmh1.jpg)
1. [] Press the **X** in the upper right-hand corner to close the Label: All Employees blade.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\em124f66.jpg)
1. [] Next, expand **Highly Confidential** and click on the **All Employees** sub-label.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\2eh6ifj5.jpg)
1. [] In the Label: All Employees blade, scroll down to the **Configure conditions for automatically applying this label** section, and click on **+ Add a new condition**.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\8cdmltcj.jpg)
1. [] In the Condition blade, in the search bar type ```credit``` and check the box next to **Credit Card Number**.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\9rozp61b.jpg)
1. [] Click **Save** in the Condition blade and **OK** to the Save settings prompt.

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\ie6g5kta.jpg)
15. [] In the Labels: All Employees blade, in the **Configure conditions for automatically applying this label** section, click **Automatic**.

   !IMAGE[245lpjvk.jpg](\Media\245lpjvk.jpg)

   > [!HINT] The policy tip is automatically updated when you switch the condition to Automatic.
1. [] Click **Save** in the Label: All Employees blade and **OK** to the Save settings prompt.

## Enforcing Configured Rules
[:arrow_up: Top](#aip-scanner-classification-labeling-and-protection)

In this task, we will set the AIP scanner to enforce the conditions we set up in the previous task and have it rerun on all files using the Start-AIPScan command.

1. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Scanner01).SelectLink and log in with the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Scanner01).Password+++.
1. [] In an **Administrative PowerShell** window, run the commands below to run an enforced scan using defined policy.

    ```
	Set-AIPScannerConfiguration -Enforce On -DiscoverInformationTypes PolicyOnly
	```
	```
	Start-AIPScan
    ```

	> [!HINT] Note that this time we used the DiscoverInformationTypes -PolicyOnly switch before starting the scan. This will have the scanner only evaluate the conditions we have explicitly defined in conditions.  This increases the effeciency of the scanner and thus is much faster.  After reviewing the event log we will see the result of the enforced scan.
	>
	>!IMAGE[k3rox8ew.jpg](\Media\k3rox8ew.jpg)
	>
	>If we switch back to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).SelectLink and look in the reports directory we opened previously at ```\\Scanner01.contoso.azure\c$\users\aipscanner\AppData\Local\Microsoft\MSIP\Scanner\Reports```, you will notice that the old scan reports are zipped in the directory and only the most recent results are showing.  
	>
	> If needed, use the credentials below:
	>
	>```Contoso\LabUser```
	>
	>```Pa$$w0rd```
	>
	>!IMAGE[s8mn092f.jpg](\Media\s8mn092f.jpg)
	>
	>Also, the DetailedReport.csv now shows the files that were protected.

## Reviewing Protected Documents
[:arrow_up: Top](#aip-scanner-classification-labeling-and-protection)

Now that we have Classified and Protected documents using the scanner, we can review the documents to see their change in status.

1. [] Switch to @lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).SelectLink and log in with the password +++@lab.VirtualMachine(Client01).Password+++.

2. [] Navigate to ```\\Scanner01.contoso.azure\documents```. 

	> If needed, use the credentials below:
	>
	>```Contoso\LabUser```
	>
    >```Pa$$w0rd```

	^IMAGE[Open Screenshot](\Media\hipavcx6.jpg)
3. [] Open one of the Contoso Purchasing Permissions documents.

    > [!NOTE] Observe that the document is classified as Confidential \ All Employees. 
    >
